## Soundboard
I wrote a simple web app that you can use to load sounds into a searchable list for easy use.

To setup loops or other features, just right-click the media controls and choose the option you want to use. 

It's pretty basic and straightforward, but it gets the job done. You have to click the play button rather than just using hot-keys like some apps you pay for, but for free, it's not a bad solution.

Have fun.


### Change this stuff
In sounboard HTML there are a few things to change to get it to work for you.
- At line 15 you'll find the title. Just put whatever you want there.
- At line 32, you'll find the list. Change the fields I've indicated to name the sound and point it to the location on your filesystem. You can add as many of these as you want as long as you put a comma after the `}` before each new line.
