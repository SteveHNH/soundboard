## Soundboard
I wrote a simple web app that you can use to load sounds into a searchable list for easy use.

To setup loops or other features, just right-click the media controls and choose the option you want to use. 

It's pretty basic and straightforward, but it gets the job done. You have to click the play button rather than just using hot-keys like some apps you pay for, but for free, it's not a bad solution.

Have fun.
